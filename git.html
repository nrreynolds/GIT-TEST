Homework Submission Process

As instructors, giving effective feedback is a must. Below is a feedback procedure & template used to facilitate effective feedback from your instructional team.

Step 1: Save your work

Unless otherwise specified, you'll need to save your work in the ~/code/wdi/COHORT.

Inside your cohort folder (scully/mulder):

git pull upstream master

git add .

git commit -m "Add hw for day 2"

git pull upstream master

git push origin master
This saves your new code and "pushes" it to your remote repository.

Step 2: Open a Github Issue

On our class repo(ga-students/WDI-xfiles-scully or ga-students/WDI-xfiles-mulder), open a Github Issue. This will let the Code Mentors know that you have code ready for them to review. Title it with your name, the date, and the name of the assignment

Completeness: scale of 0 to [Last Part]

Comfortability: scale of 0 to 5

Win: What is something that felt good during the assignment?

Challenge: What did you find the most challenging?

Comments or Questions: Any other comments about this assignment?

Step 3: Get Feedback

We give feedback at least one assignment each week but sometimes the timing is a bit off when things get hectic. Please bear with us, and also keep a growth mindset when receiving feedback. Our goal is not to put you down, but encourage best practices so that when you get into field no one wants to murder you in your sleep.
